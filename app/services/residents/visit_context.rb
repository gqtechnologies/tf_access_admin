module Residents
  # Resolves and validates the resident authorization context for visit creation.
  #
  # Encapsulates tasks 2.1–2.7 of the resident private API:
  #   - Resolves the authenticated User and their Person in the active organization (2.1)
  #   - Accepts a tenant-safe Unit already loaded by the caller (2.2)
  #   - Verifies that the Person has an active, currently-valid UnitOccupancy or
  #     UnitOwnership on that unit (2.3 / 2.4) — delegated to GrantProfile via
  #     ActiveRelationships, which enforces status and date bounds
  #   - Requires create_visits AND authorize_visits on that specific unit (2.5)
  #   - Respects can_authorize_visits on occupancies — GrantProfile adds
  #     RESIDENT_AUTHORIZE_VISITS only when the flag is true (2.6)
  #   - Relies on Resolver#cross_organization_context? to block cross-org/cross-unit
  #     escalation (2.7)
  #
  # Usage:
  #   ctx = Residents::VisitContext.new(user: current_user, organization: current_organization, unit: unit)
  #   raise Pundit::NotAuthorizedError unless ctx.authorized?
  #   ctx.host_person  # => Person of the authenticated resident
  class VisitContext

    def initialize(user:, organization:, unit:)
      @user         = user
      @organization = organization
      @unit         = unit
    end

    # Returns true only when the user has both create_visits and authorize_visits
    # for the given unit within the current organization. Any inactive, expired,
    # future-dated, or soft-deleted relationship — or a UnitOccupancy with
    # can_authorize_visits = false — produces false.
