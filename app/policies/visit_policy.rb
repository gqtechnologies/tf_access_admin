# frozen_string_literal: true

# Authorization policy for +Visit+ records.
#
# Capability-to-action contract (implementation of OpenSpec visit-management §5):
#
#   index?      → manage_visits / view_visits (admin) or view_authorized_visits (concierge)
#   show?       → manage_visits / view_visits (full) or view_authorized_visits (restricted)
#   create?     → create_visits (resident/owner unit context) or manage_visits (admin)
#   update?     → manage_visits (admin only)
#   authorize?  → authorize_visits (resident/owner unit context) or manage_visits (admin)
#   cancel?     → manage_visits or authorize_visits, only while pending/authorized
#   check_in?   → register_visit_entry, scoped to the visit's residential_property
#   check_out?  → register_visit_exit, scoped to the visit's residential_property
#
# Concierge (operational) actors MUST NOT create, update, authorize or cancel
# visits in the MVP (§5.6); they only hold view_authorized_visits plus the
# operational register_visit_entry/register_visit_exit capabilities. Check-in
# and check-out stay out of administration unless the actor explicitly holds the
# operational capability (§5.9); state validity is enforced by the AASM
# transitions, not by the policy boolean.
#
# Detail granularity (§5.7):
#   - full_detail?       → manage_visits / view_visits
#   - restricted_detail? → view_authorized_visits without full access (concierge)
#
# Scope rules (§5.3–5.5):
#   - tenant_admin / content_manager → all visits in the organization
#   - property_admin                 → all visits on assigned (managed) properties
#   - concierge                      → operational visits (authorized, checked_in,
#                                       recently checked_out) on assigned properties only
#   - resident/owner                 → visits linked to their active units only
#   - client without assignment      → no visits
#   - cross-organization             → always denied
