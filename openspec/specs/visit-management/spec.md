# Visit Management

## Purpose

Enable visit creation and administration, plus operational check-in/check-out, within strict organization, property, unit, state, and capability boundaries. Visitors and hosts are canonical `Person` records; authenticated actors are `User` records.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Visit location and identities are tenant-consistent

The system SHALL persist each visit with organization, property, optional section, unit, visitor person, and host person belonging to the same organization. Property and section SHALL be derived from the selected unit.

#### Scenario: Coherent visit location is persisted

- **GIVEN** unit U belongs to property P and optional section S in organization O
- **WHEN** an authorized actor creates a visit for U
- **THEN** the visit stores O, P, S, and U consistently
- **AND** the visitor and host are `Person` records in O

#### Scenario: Host without active unit relationship is rejected

- **GIVEN** a person has no active ownership or occupancy on unit U
- **WHEN** that person is submitted as host for U
- **THEN** the visit is rejected
- **AND** no record is persisted

### Requirement: Authenticated action actors are Users

The system SHALL use `User` references for `created_by`, `authorized_by`, `checked_in_by`, `checked_out_by`, and functional history actors.

#### Scenario: Visit creation records authenticated user

- **GIVEN** an authorized user submits a valid visit
- **WHEN** creation succeeds
- **THEN** `created_by_id` references that `User`
- **AND** visitor and host remain `Person` references

### Requirement: Backend resolves initial visit status

The system SHALL determine initial status from backend authorization and SHALL NOT trust a client-supplied status without validating capability and scope.

#### Scenario: Authorized administrator creates an authorized visit

- **GIVEN** an actor has `manage_visits` and authority to authorize in the selected scope
- **WHEN** the actor creates a valid visit requesting immediate authorization
- **THEN** the visit is created as `authorized`
- **AND** `authorized_by_id` records the actor

#### Scenario: Creator without direct authorization creates pending visit

- **GIVEN** an actor has `create_visits` but not `authorize_visits` or applicable `manage_visits`
- **WHEN** the actor creates a valid visit
- **THEN** the backend creates it as `pending`
- **AND** ignores any unauthorized request for `authorized`

### Requirement: MVP status transitions are enforced

The system SHALL permit only `pending -> authorized`, `pending -> cancelled`, `authorized -> checked_in`, `authorized -> cancelled`, and `checked_in -> checked_out`.

#### Scenario: Pending visit is authorized

- **GIVEN** a visit is `pending`
- **WHEN** an actor allowed by `authorize?` authorizes it
- **THEN** it becomes `authorized`

#### Scenario: Authorized visit is checked in

- **GIVEN** a visit is `authorized` and inside its validity window
- **WHEN** an actor allowed by `check_in?` confirms entry
- **THEN** it becomes `checked_in`

#### Scenario: Checked-in visit is checked out

- **GIVEN** a visit is `checked_in`
- **WHEN** an actor allowed by `check_out?` confirms exit
- **THEN** it becomes `checked_out`

#### Scenario: Pending or authorized visit is cancelled

- **GIVEN** a visit is `pending` or `authorized`
- **WHEN** an actor allowed by `cancel?` cancels it
- **THEN** it becomes `cancelled`

### Requirement: Invalid transitions do not mutate visits

The system MUST reject check-in from any state other than `authorized`, check-out from any state other than `checked_in`, and cancellation from `checked_in`, `checked_out`, or `cancelled`.

#### Scenario: Pending visit cannot check in

- **GIVEN** a visit is `pending`
- **WHEN** any actor attempts check-in
- **THEN** the transition is rejected
- **AND** status remains `pending`

#### Scenario: Authorized visit cannot check out directly

- **GIVEN** a visit is `authorized`
- **WHEN** any actor attempts check-out
- **THEN** the transition is rejected
- **AND** status remains `authorized`

#### Scenario: Checked-in visit cannot be cancelled

- **GIVEN** a visit is `checked_in`
- **WHEN** an actor attempts cancellation
- **THEN** the transition is rejected
- **AND** status remains `checked_in`

### Requirement: Functional history is distinct from technical audit

The system SHALL maintain user-visible functional history independently from `audited`. Each event SHALL include visit, organization, event type, from/to status, actor user, occurrence time, notes, and metadata.

#### Scenario: Creation event is recorded

- **GIVEN** a visit is successfully created
- **WHEN** the creation transaction commits
- **THEN** a `created` functional event is persisted
- **AND** it includes `actor_user_id`, `occurred_at`, organization, and resulting status

#### Scenario: Every MVP transition records an event

- **GIVEN** an authorize, check-in, check-out, or cancel transition succeeds
- **WHEN** the transaction commits
- **THEN** an `authorized`, `checked_in`, `checked_out`, or `cancelled` event is persisted
- **AND** it records from/to status and actor

#### Scenario: Timeline uses functional history

- **GIVEN** a user opens visit detail
- **WHEN** history is serialized
- **THEN** the timeline and actor panel are built from functional events
- **AND** technical audit records are not required as the user-facing timeline

### Requirement: Check-in persists operational metadata

The system SHALL allow check-in metadata for access point, access type, optional vehicle plate, and notes.

#### Scenario: Concierge checks in with metadata

- **GIVEN** a visit is `authorized` in the concierge's assigned property
- **WHEN** the concierge confirms check-in with operational fields
- **THEN** `Visits::CheckIn` persists actor and timestamp
- **AND** stores allowed operational metadata
- **AND** records a `checked_in` functional event with that metadata

### Requirement: Check-out persists operational metadata

The system SHALL allow check-out metadata for access point, optional incident type, and notes.

#### Scenario: Concierge checks out with metadata

- **GIVEN** a visit is `checked_in` in the concierge's assigned property
- **WHEN** the concierge confirms check-out with operational fields
