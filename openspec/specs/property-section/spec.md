# property-section Specification

## Purpose

Define the tenant-safe hierarchical, lifecycle, service, tree, and authorization contract for structural sections within a residential property.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Property section belongs to organization and property

The system SHALL require every `PropertySection` to belong to exactly one organization and one residential property whose organization matches the section organization.

#### Scenario: Section derives organization from property

- **GIVEN** property P belongs to organization O
- **WHEN** an authorized actor creates a section under P
- **THEN** the section references P and O
- **AND** organization is derived from trusted property context

#### Scenario: Section without property is rejected

- **WHEN** section creation has no valid residential property
- **THEN** creation is rejected
- **AND** no section is persisted

#### Scenario: Section without organization is rejected

- **GIVEN** no organization can be derived from the property context
- **WHEN** section creation is attempted
- **THEN** creation is rejected

#### Scenario: Section and property organization mismatch is rejected

- **GIVEN** P belongs to organization O
- **WHEN** a section attempts to reference organization Q
- **THEN** validation rejects the section

### Requirement: Property section may have one parent section

The system SHALL allow a section to be either a root section with no parent or a subsection whose parent is a root section in the same property.

#### Scenario: Root section is created

- **GIVEN** active property P
- **WHEN** an authorized actor creates `Torre A` without a parent
- **THEN** the section is a root of P

#### Scenario: Subsection is created

- **GIVEN** active section `Torre A` in P
- **WHEN** an authorized actor creates `Piso 1` with `Torre A` as parent
- **THEN** `Piso 1` is persisted as its child

#### Scenario: Third hierarchy level is rejected

- **GIVEN** an active hierarchy `Etapa 1 -> Edificio 3`
- **WHEN** an authorized actor attempts to create `Piso 1` under `Edificio 3`
- **THEN** the operation is rejected
- **AND** no third hierarchy level is persisted

### Requirement: Parent section must belong to same property

The system MUST require a section and its parent to belong to the same residential property.

#### Scenario: Parent from another property is rejected

- **GIVEN** parent S belongs to property P
- **AND** a new section belongs to property Q
- **WHEN** S is submitted as parent
- **THEN** creation or movement is rejected
- **AND** no cross-property hierarchy is created

### Requirement: Parent section must belong to same organization

The system MUST require a section and its parent to belong to the same organization.

#### Scenario: Parent from another organization is rejected

- **GIVEN** parent S belongs to organization O
- **AND** the target section context belongs to Q
- **WHEN** S is submitted as parent
- **THEN** the operation is rejected without exposing inaccessible hierarchy data

### Requirement: Property section hierarchy is limited to two levels

The system SHALL enforce a maximum hierarchy depth of two levels: root section and subsection.

#### Scenario: Root section has depth one

- **GIVEN** section S has no parent
- **WHEN** S is evaluated in the hierarchy
- **THEN** S is treated as a root section

#### Scenario: Subsection has root parent

- **GIVEN** root section R belongs to property P
- **WHEN** section S is created with R as parent
- **THEN** S is accepted as a subsection
- **AND** S has no children below it by default

#### Scenario: Subsection cannot receive child section

- **GIVEN** subsection S already has a parent
- **WHEN** an actor attempts to create another section under S
- **THEN** the operation is rejected
- **AND** the hierarchy remains limited to two levels

#### Scenario: Move under subsection is rejected

- **GIVEN** subsection S already has a parent
- **AND** section X belongs to the same property
- **WHEN** X is moved under S
- **THEN** the move is rejected
- **AND** no third hierarchy level is created

### Requirement: Property section hierarchy cannot contain cycles

The system MUST prevent direct and indirect cycles at model, service, and persistence boundaries.

#### Scenario: Section cannot parent itself

- **GIVEN** existing section S
- **WHEN** S is moved with `parent_id = S.id`
- **THEN** the move is rejected
- **AND** the hierarchy is unchanged

#### Scenario: Section cannot move below its child

- **GIVEN** hierarchy `A -> B`
- **WHEN** A is moved under B
- **THEN** the move is rejected
- **AND** no cycle is persisted

#### Scenario: Valid two-level hierarchy remains traversable

- **GIVEN** an acyclic hierarchy with roots and subsections
- **WHEN** it is traversed
- **THEN** every node is reached at most once
- **AND** no node appears below the second level

### Requirement: Property section name is normalized

The system SHALL derive `normalized_name` from the section name using canonical whitespace, Unicode, and case-insensitive normalization.

#### Scenario: Name is normalized before persistence

- **WHEN** an actor submits `  Piso   Norte `
- **THEN** the display name is trimmed
- **AND** `normalized_name` stores the canonical comparison value

#### Scenario: Blank normalized name is rejected

- **WHEN** a section name normalizes to blank
- **THEN** the operation is rejected with a name error

### Requirement: Property section name is unique under same parent

The system SHALL enforce normalized-name uniqueness among non-deleted sibling sections in the same property and parent context, including root sections.

#### Scenario: Duplicate sibling name is rejected

- **GIVEN** parent A has child `Piso 1`
- **WHEN** another child under A is submitted as ` piso   1 `
- **THEN** the operation is rejected
- **AND** no duplicate sibling is persisted

#### Scenario: Duplicate root name is rejected

- **GIVEN** P has root section `Torre A`
- **WHEN** another root in P is submitted as `torre a`
- **THEN** the operation is rejected

#### Scenario: Concurrent duplicate sibling is protected

- **GIVEN** two requests concurrently create the same normalized sibling name
- **WHEN** both commit
- **THEN** at most one section is persisted
- **AND** the other request receives a controlled domain error

### Requirement: Same section name may exist under different parent

The system SHALL allow the same normalized section name in different parent contexts within the same property.

#### Scenario: Different towers may each have Piso 1

- **GIVEN** P has roots `Torre A` and `Torre B`
- **WHEN** each root receives a child named `Piso 1`
- **THEN** both sections are valid
- **AND** their paths distinguish them

### Requirement: Property section has controlled section type

The system SHALL require `section_type` to belong to the canonical section-type catalog.

#### Scenario: Canonical type is accepted

- **WHEN** a section uses `building`, `tower`, `floor`, `block`, `stage`, `sector`, `parking_area`, `storage_area`, or `other`
- **THEN** the type may be persisted

#### Scenario: Unknown type is rejected

- **WHEN** a section uses a type outside the configured catalog
- **THEN** creation or update is rejected

### Requirement: Only selected section types may contain units

The system SHALL define `block`, `tower`, and `floor` as the only section types eligible to contain units.

#### Scenario: Eligible section type may contain units

- **WHEN** a section has `section_type` `block`, `tower`, or `floor`
- **THEN** it is eligible for future unit association, subject to property, status, and authorization rules

#### Scenario: Non-eligible section type cannot contain units

- **WHEN** a section has `section_type` `building`, `stage`, `sector`, `parking_area`, `storage_area`, or `other`
- **THEN** it is not eligible for direct unit association

#### Scenario: Unit change consumes eligibility contract

- **WHEN** a future unit flow assigns a unit to a section
- **THEN** it must verify that the section type is `block`, `tower`, or `floor`

### Requirement: Property section has controlled status

The system SHALL restrict status to `active`, `inactive`, or `archived`, with `active` as the ordinary creation default.

#### Scenario: New section defaults to active

- **GIVEN** its property and parent are effectively active
- **WHEN** a valid section is created
- **THEN** its status is `active`

#### Scenario: Invalid status is rejected

- **WHEN** an unknown status is submitted
- **THEN** the operation is rejected

#### Scenario: Inactive ancestor makes descendant non-operational

- **GIVEN** child C has `status = active`
- **AND** an ancestor has `status = inactive`
- **WHEN** C's effective status is evaluated
- **THEN** C is not effectively active

#### Scenario: Archived property prevents section mutation

- **GIVEN** P is archived
- **WHEN** an actor attempts ordinary create, update, move, or archive mutation below P
- **THEN** the operation is denied according to the property lifecycle contract

### Requirement: Sibling position controls stable ordering

The system SHALL use `position` values to order siblings and SHALL provide a deterministic secondary order. When position is not provided, the system MAY assign a controlled default.

#### Scenario: Siblings are ordered by position and name

- **GIVEN** siblings have different or equal positions
- **WHEN** they are serialized in the hierarchy
- **THEN** lower position appears first
- **AND** ties are ordered by normalized name and stable identifier

### Requirement: Property section can be moved safely within same property

The system SHALL move a section within the same property through `PropertySections::Move` while preserving valid child subsections when applicable.

#### Scenario: Root moves under another root as subsection

- **GIVEN** roots A and B belong to active property P
- **WHEN** A is moved under B
- **THEN** A becomes a subsection of B
- **AND** organization and property do not change
- **AND** no third level is created

#### Scenario: Subsection moves to root

- **GIVEN** subsection C belongs to P
- **WHEN** C is moved to the root context
- **THEN** `parent_id` becomes null
- **AND** sibling uniqueness and position are revalidated

#### Scenario: Subsection cannot move under another subsection

- **GIVEN** subsection C belongs to P
- **AND** subsection S also belongs to P
- **WHEN** C is moved under S
- **THEN** the move is rejected
- **AND** the hierarchy remains limited to two levels

#### Scenario: Move causing sibling duplicate is rejected

- **GIVEN** target parent already has `Piso 1`
- **WHEN** another `Piso 1` is moved under that parent
- **THEN** the move is rejected
- **AND** the original hierarchy remains unchanged

### Requirement: Property section cannot be moved across property incorrectly

The system MUST keep a section and its subtree in their original property and organization during move.

#### Scenario: Cross-property move is rejected

- **GIVEN** section S belongs to P
- **WHEN** a request attempts to move S under a parent in Q
- **THEN** the operation is rejected
- **AND** S remains in P

#### Scenario: Client cannot change property during update

- **GIVEN** S belongs to P
- **WHEN** update includes `residential_property_id = Q`
- **THEN** the untrusted value is ignored or rejected
- **AND** S remains in P

### Requirement: Property section can be archived instead of physically deleted

The system SHALL archive a section non-destructively and SHALL preserve subsections, units, visits, and history.

#### Scenario: Section with children is archived

- **GIVEN** S has child sections
- **WHEN** an authorized actor archives S
- **THEN** S becomes `archived`
- **AND** its children remain persisted
- **AND** its subsections become effectively non-operational

#### Scenario: Section with units is archived

- **GIVEN** S has units
- **WHEN** an authorized actor archives S
- **THEN** S becomes `archived`
- **AND** its units are not hard-deleted

#### Scenario: Hard delete with dependencies is denied

- **GIVEN** S has children, units, visits, or other dependencies
- **WHEN** physical or soft deletion is attempted through the normal admin flow
- **THEN** deletion is denied
- **AND** archive remains the supported lifecycle operation

### Requirement: TreeBuilder returns property-scoped hierarchy

The system SHALL provide `PropertySections::TreeBuilder` that returns an ordered two-level hierarchy for one authorized property without leaking another tenant or property.

#### Scenario: Builder returns roots and subsections

- **GIVEN** P has multiple roots and subsections
- **WHEN** the tree is built for P
- **THEN** every in-scope section appears once under its parent
- **AND** no node is returned below the second level
- **AND** siblings follow deterministic order

#### Scenario: Builder returns UI metadata

- **WHEN** a section node is serialized
- **THEN** it includes id, name, type, position, persisted/effective status, parent, depth, path, children, and backend-computed permissions/actions
- **AND** `add_child` is false for subsections

#### Scenario: Builder excludes another property

- **GIVEN** sections exist in P and Q
- **WHEN** the tree is built for P
- **THEN** no section from Q is returned

#### Scenario: Builder excludes another organization

- **GIVEN** a similarly identified property exists in another organization
- **WHEN** the tree is built in the current tenant
- **THEN** no foreign-organization node is returned

#### Scenario: Builder handles invalid stored graph defensively

- **GIVEN** legacy or corrupted data contains an orphan or cycle
- **WHEN** the tree is built
- **THEN** traversal terminates safely
- **AND** the invalid node is reported or isolated rather than leaking or looping

### Requirement: Tenant admin can manage sections in own organization

The system SHALL allow a tenant administrator to view, create, update, move, change allowed status, and archive sections only within properties of the administrator's organization.

#### Scenario: Tenant admin manages section in own tenant

- **GIVEN** A is tenant admin of O
- **AND** S belongs to active property P in O
- **WHEN** A performs an allowed section operation
- **THEN** authorization succeeds through `Authorization::Resolver` and Pundit

#### Scenario: Tenant admin cannot manage another tenant

- **GIVEN** S belongs to organization Q
- **AND** A is tenant admin of O
- **WHEN** A attempts to access S
- **THEN** authorization is denied

### Requirement: Property admin access is scoped to assigned properties

The system SHALL allow a property administrator to manage sections only where an active, currently valid `StaffAssignment` grants `manage_sections`.

#### Scenario: Assigned property admin manages section

- **GIVEN** A has an active property-admin assignment for P
- **WHEN** A manages a section in P
- **THEN** authorization succeeds

#### Scenario: Inactive assignment grants no access

- **GIVEN** A's assignment for P is inactive, future-dated, or expired
- **WHEN** A attempts to manage a section in P
- **THEN** authorization is denied

#### Scenario: Property admin role is not global

- **GIVEN** A is property admin for P only
- **WHEN** A attempts to manage a section in Q
- **THEN** authorization is denied
- **AND** Q is excluded from policy scope

### Requirement: Cross-organization and cross-property access are denied

The system MUST deny viewing or mutating sections outside the actor's organization and accessible property scope.

#### Scenario: Cross-organization section is hidden

- **WHEN** `PropertySectionPolicy::Scope` resolves
- **THEN** sections from other organizations are excluded

#### Scenario: Cross-property parent is not exposed as option

- **GIVEN** actor A manages P but not Q
- **WHEN** parent options are built for a section in P
- **THEN** no section from Q appears

#### Scenario: User without permission is denied

- **GIVEN** A lacks `manage_sections` for P
- **WHEN** A attempts view, create, update, move, or archive
- **THEN** authorization is denied
- **AND** no mutation occurs

### Requirement: Section mutations use domain services

The system SHALL execute section creation, update, movement, and archive through domain services rather than controller-only logic.

#### Scenario: Create uses service

- **WHEN** an authorized create request is processed
- **THEN** the controller invokes `PropertySections::Create`
- **AND** the service validates property, parent, name, position and authorization

#### Scenario: Update uses service

- **WHEN** an authorized descriptive update is processed
- **THEN** the controller invokes `PropertySections::Update`
- **AND** parent/property lifecycle is not changed implicitly

#### Scenario: Move uses service

- **WHEN** an authorized parent or position change is requested
- **THEN** the controller invokes `PropertySections::Move`
- **AND** hierarchy and concurrency rules are revalidated

#### Scenario: Archive uses service

- **WHEN** an authorized archive request is processed
- **THEN** the controller invokes `PropertySections::Archive`
- **AND** does not use cascading destroy as archive behavior

#### Scenario: Frontend cannot bypass domain rules

- **GIVEN** frontend validation or disabled controls are bypassed
- **WHEN** an invalid mutation reaches the backend
- **THEN** service/model/policy validation rejects it
