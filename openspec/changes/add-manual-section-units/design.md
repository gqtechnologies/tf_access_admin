## Context

The setup wizard already separates structure definition in step 2 from unit creation in step 3. Step 2 uses `ManualSectionForm.vue`, `ManualSectionTreeRow.vue`, and the shared `StructurePreviewPanel.vue` / `StructurePreviewTreeNode.vue` pattern for live structure feedback. Step 3 already supports unit creation modes and automatic previews through `Properties::Setup::GenerateUnitsPreview`, `Properties::Setup::ApplyAutomaticUnits`, and `Units::Create`.

This change adds manual unit management to step 3 without changing the two-level section model. Unit actions must remain tenant-scoped to the draft property and must continue delegating to `Units::*` services and `UnitPolicy`.

Affected models: `ResidentialProperty`, `PropertySection`, `Unit`.
Affected services: `Properties::Setup::*`, `Units::Create`, `Units::Update`, `Units::SoftDelete`.
Affected tables: `residential_properties`, `property_sections`, `units`.
Integration points: `Admin::PropertySetup::WizardController`, `Admin::PropertySetup::WizardSerializer`, property setup Vue components, shared preview components, unit schemas/forms, routes, i18n.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Show a manual unit management mode in step 3 using the visual pattern from `ManualSectionForm` and `ManualSectionTreeRow`.
- Let users add one unit or many units from an eligible section, or directly under the property with no section.
- Let users edit a unit's descriptive fields in a dialog: `area_m2`, optional `display_name`, `unit_type`, and `identifier`.
- Let users delete a unit only after confirmation, using soft delete.
- Keep all unit mutations scoped to the current draft property and organization.
- Internationalize all new labels, empty states, validation messages, dialog copy, and action text in `es`, `en`, and `pt`.

**Non-Goals:**

- Moving units between sections from the edit dialog.
- Hard-deleting units.
- Changing ownership, occupancy, visit, import, or property confirmation behavior.
- Replacing the existing automatic generation path for quick structures.
- Adding a new UI library or a new domain abstraction for validation already covered by `Unit`.

## Decisions

### Reuse the manual section tree visual pattern for manual unit management

The step 3 manual section view will reuse the `ManualSectionForm` / `ManualSectionTreeRow` visual pattern and render persisted units beneath each section. In unit-management mode, eligible section rows expose only "add unit"; ineligible section rows do not show the action. Section edit/add-child/delete actions remain step 2 concerns. A property-level unit area provides the same add/edit/delete unit behavior for units without a section.

Alternative considered: create a separate unit tree component. This was rejected because it would duplicate the preview hierarchy and increase the risk of step 2 and step 3 rendering the same structure differently.

### Add a unit-management mode to step 3 instead of changing step 2

Manual unit creation belongs in step 3 as a new `manual` units mode alongside automatic and import. Step 2 remains responsible for defining sections only, and its preview continues to render sections without unit actions.

Alternative considered: adding units in step 2 while building sections. This was rejected because it blurs the wizard's step responsibilities and conflicts with the existing five-step contract.

### Resolve section placement on the server

When a user adds units from a section row, the client sends the selected section ID and unit payload. The controller resolves the section through the current draft property and organization before calling `Units::Create`. Invalid, foreign, deleted, or non-eligible sections are rejected by the same rules used by the `Unit` contract. When the user adds units from the property-level action, no `property_section_id` is sent and units are created directly under the property.

Alternative considered: trusting the preview's section data in the client. This was rejected because tenant isolation and section eligibility must be enforced server-side.

### Mirror section multiple-creation semantics for units

Manual multiple unit creation will use the same interaction model as manual multiple section creation: Individual and Multiple modes, `cantidad`, optional `prefijo`, `formato` (`letter`/`number`), the same quantity and suffix-range limits, and a live "De creación" preview. For units, generated names become generated identifiers. Batch fields such as `unit_type` and optional `area_m2` apply to every generated unit. `display_name` is not available in multiple mode.

Multiple creation is all-or-nothing. The server validates and persists the batch inside a transaction; if any planned unit fails, the transaction rolls back and the user sees a descriptive alert. Partial success is not allowed.

Alternative considered: allowing partial success and row-level errors. This was rejected because the preview would no longer represent what was persisted and cleanup would be confusing inside the setup wizard.

### Keep edit descriptive and placement-safe

The edit dialog updates only `area_m2`, `display_name`, `unit_type`, and `identifier` through `Units::Update`. It does not accept `property_section_id`, property, organization, lifecycle, or client-supplied code fields. Identifier updates re-run normalization, uniqueness validation, and server-derived code generation using the unit's current placement context. If the regenerated code collides with another non-deleted unit code, the identifier change is rejected and the unit keeps its previous identifier and code.

Alternative considered: allow changing the section from the edit dialog. This was rejected because placement changes already belong to `Units::MoveToSection` and have distinct uniqueness and eligibility semantics.

### Delete through explicit soft-delete service

Manual unit deletion will call `Units::SoftDelete` and never `destroy` directly. The confirmation dialog must appear before the request is sent and must always show a generic warning that related records and audit/history are preserved. Related records do not block the soft delete. Successful deletion removes the unit from the rendered preview because non-deleted units are the visible set.

Alternative considered: use `Units::Archive`. This was rejected because the requested behavior is deletion that releases the identifier context, while archive is a non-destructive business retirement that preserves uniqueness.

### Require manage_units in the wizard

Inside the setup wizard, unit creation, edit, and soft-delete require the property-scoped `manage_units` permission. Setup authorization alone is not sufficient for unit mutations.

Alternative considered: treating setup authorization as sufficient. This was rejected because unit mutations should continue respecting the unit management capability boundary.

### Default units mode by creation/resume state

When a draft reaches step 3 for the first time after quick structure creation, automatic mode remains the default. When editing or resuming a draft that already has units or persisted unit-step state, manual mode is selected by default so persisted units are immediately visible and manageable.

### Use existing form conventions

New unit dialogs will define schemas under `app/javascript/lib/schemas/`, use Zod with VeeValidate, display translated errors through `FieldError` and `useTranslateErrors`, and merge server errors with `useServerFormErrors`.

Alternative considered: simple local form state. This was rejected because project form conventions require Zod and VeeValidate for every form.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Risk] Multiple creation could partially persist if one unit fails. -> Mitigation: run manual unit batches in an all-or-nothing transaction and show a descriptive alert when the batch rolls back.
- [Risk] Existing automatic generation and new manual multiple creation may diverge. -> Mitigation: keep automatic generation unchanged and define manual multiple allocation separately with explicit preview/confirmation behavior.
- [Risk] Unit deletion could affect later ownership/occupancy work. -> Mitigation: soft delete only, preserve audit/history, and avoid touching ownership/occupancy flows in this change.
- [Risk] Client-side preview could show stale units after mutation. -> Mitigation: reload wizard props or update the preview from the persisted response after every successful create, edit, or delete.
- [Risk] Regenerating code on identifier edit may collide with an existing unit code. -> Mitigation: reject the identifier update with a controlled error and keep the previous identifier/code.
- [Risk] New UI text could miss one locale. -> Mitigation: add keys for `es`, `en`, and `pt` with the same namespace as the setup wizard.
